<h3>About Me</h3>
I'm currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Texas A&M University math department. My field of study is analytic number theory and my advisor is Dr. Matt Young. Outside of math, my hobbies include coding (Python in particular) and playing the piano. <br/>
<br/>
Since middle school, I've been very involved with the competitive math scene in the state of Texas. During my time
here at A&M, I've remained involved by helping to coach teams competing at ARML and HMMT, volunteering
at contests such as MATHCOUNTS State and the Texas A&M High School Contest, and also contributing some
math problems of my own creation to contests.
