This is the home page for the practice MATHCOUNTS event that the Austin Math Circle hosted
annually from 2017 to 2023. The contest served as a means for students from all over Texas to compete
at a MATHCOUNTS-style event before the Chapter and State contests. Our intention was to tailor the
problems to be approachable to casual competitors, and yet still provide a challenge for seasoned competitors
hoping to use this contest as a warm-up for the State meet in March. <b>As of 2023, the contest has been
discontinued, but problems and results from previous years remain viewable on this page.</b>

<br>
<br>
<i>Note that our contest is not officially affiliated with the <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/">MATHCOUNTS</a> foundation and competitions. This contest is intended solely as a regional practice and is never run for profit.</i>

<h3>The sixth annual contest was held at St. Edward's University, on Saturday, January 14th, 2023.</h3>
