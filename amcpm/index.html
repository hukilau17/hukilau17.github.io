This is the home page for the practice MATHCOUNTS event that the Austin Math Circle hosts
annually. The goal of the contest is to provide a way for students from all over Texas to compete
at a MATHCOUNTS-style event before the Chapter and State contests. Our intention is to tailor the
problems to be approachable to casual competitors, and yet still provide a challenge for seasoned competitors
hoping to use this contest as a warm-up for the State meet in March.

<br>
<br>
<i>Note that our contest is not officially affiliated with the <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/">MATHCOUNTS</a> foundation and competitions. This contest is intended solely as a regional practice and is never run for profit.</i>

<h3> The sixth annual contest will be held at St. Edward's University, on Saturday, January 14th, 2023. Register <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScg8u-ONFspUo0nCZy_oRhvDSk7Y5xfr1C-sN3lx3VOcbwzSA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</h3>
