<h2>Some frequently asked questions about the Austin Math Circle Practice MATHCOUNTS</h2>

<h3>What is the structure of this contest?</h3>
This contest follows the <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/">MATHCOUNTS</a> competition format, which means
it consists of four rounds:
<ul>
<li> The <b>Sprint Round</b> consists of 30 short-answer problems to be done individually in 40 minutes
without the use of calculators. Each correct answer is worth one point. </li>
<li> The <b>Target Round</b> consists of four pairs of two questions each to be done individually in
six minutes per pair. Calculators are allowed. Each correct answer is worth two points. 
Thus a perfect individual score is 30+2*8 = 46.</li>
<li> The <b>Team Round</b> consists of ten questions to be done by the whole team (of at most four students)
working together in 20 minutes. Calculators are allowed. The score of a team at the end of the competition
is the average of the individual (Sprint and Target) scores of its members, plus twice the number of correct
answers on the Team round. Thus a perfect team score is (30+2*8) + 2*10 = 66.</li>
<li> The <b>Countdown Round</b> is a single elimination bracket in which the top-scoring students on
the Sprint and Target rounds compete head-to-head. Both students are given a single problem to work at the
same time, and the point is awarded to whoever buzzes in with the correct answer first.</li>
</ul>
At this contest, there will also be a <b>Challenge Round</b>, which is unofficial and optional, and consists
of a set of extra-tricky problems to keep students entertained during the break. The schedule
for last year's contest can be found <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.

<h3>What is the difficulty level of this contest?</h3>
We aim to make our contest roughly the same difficulty level as MATHCOUNTS State. The previous four contests
are available <a href="archive.html">here</a> if you want to get a feel for the difficulty, but note that
the inaugural 2018 contest was extra hard and turned out to be closer to MATHCOUNTS National in difficulty level.
(Also note that the 2021 countdown round was infamously hard. This was partially by design, since it was held online
and we had to make sure there were no instant buzz questions.)

<h3>Who can compete at this contest?</h3>
Any student from Texas in 8th grade or below is welcome to compete with us. We recommend that students compete
with their school teams, but if nobody else from your school is coming, you are also welcome to compete with us
as an individual.

<h3>Who <i>should</i> compete at this contest?</h3>
The Austin Math Circle Practice MATHCOUNTS was conceived with two goals in mind: to provide a mock contest that
helps serious competitors to prepare for the State meet, and to provide an opportunity for newcomers and 
more casual competitors to engage with the math community outside of the Chapter and State meets. With that
being said, we do not want any student who comes to this contest to run out of things to do during the written tests,
as this is a very demoralizing experience. For this reason, we recommend that students who compete with us
should generally be able to score at least 20 points (out of 46) on recent MATHCOUNTS Chapter competitions.
If you are brand-new to contest math, or if you've practiced on MATHCOUNTS Chapter or School tests before
but aren't consistently able to score this high, you are still welcome to compete with us if you want to,
but there are other MATHCOUNTS-type contests that will likely be more approachable to you, such as the
Mathletes in Action (SPURS) event in the fall, and the MATHCOUNTS Chapter meet itself.

<h3>Where is the contest?</h3>
We plan to hold this year's contest in the Carter Auditorium at the John Brooks Williams Natural Sciences Center at St. Edward's University.

<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
Make sure you bring pencils and a calculator. Scratch paper will be provided at the contest. Any calculator without a QWERTY keyboard can be used during the 
Target and Team Rounds. No other tools (including but not limited to graph paper, compasses, and protractors) will be permitted, matching the format of an official MATHCOUNTS competition. <br/>

<h3>How much does it cost to compete?</h3>
Registration will cost $6 per student. This is to cover the cost of printing and awards. (We never run this event for profit. Any extra money that we do not spend will be donated to the MATHCOUNTS foundation after the contest.)
