<h2>Some frequently asked questions about the Texas HMMT November Team</h2>

<h3>What is HMMT?</h3>
The <a href="https://www.hmmt.co/">Harvard-MIT Math Tournament</a> (HMMT) is a high school math contest held
twice a year in Cambridge, MA. It is one of the largest in-person math contests in the world, with roughly
900 people competing at every meet. This team competes at the November meet, which is less challenging than
the February meet. You can get a feel for the difficulty of both contests by looking at tests from previous
years on the tournament's website. 

<i>Update in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: This year, students will not travel in person
to Cambridge to compete, but will instead compete online.</i> 

<h3>Who is eligible to join the team?</h3>
Any student in high school or below who attends school in the state of Texas (this includes homeschoolers),
and <b>is not eligible for an HMMT November team organized by their local school/club</b>, is eligible to
join our team. Due to HMMT regional policy, no student should ever be eligible for more than one team. Thus,
our region is ideally defined as the entire state of Texas, but since we cannot stop schools from forming their own
smaller teams, our regional definition must exclude anyone who attends a school that does this. The three schools
in Texas that sent their own teams last year are <b>St. Mark's School of Texas</b>, <b>Texas Academy of Math and Science</b>,
and <b>The Hockaday School</b>. Also, the rule about students attending school in the state of Texas (rather than residing in the state of
Texas) is to avoid murky situations where someone who is from Texas, but attends a magnet school such as Phillips
Exeter in a different state, is eligible for multiple teams.

<h3>How do I join the team?</h3>
At the moment, our team is likely to be full or almost full; but you can reach out via email to mdkroesche [AT] tamu.edu
and I will let you know if we have a spot open for you. <del>Sometime prior to the contest in November, a Team Selection Test (TST) will be 
administered to the students who are planning on going.</del> <i>Update for 2021: the team will be decided based on credentials this year.</i>
Students will then be grouped into teams of six based on the results of team selection, together with results from AMC/AIME, previous HMMT performance (if any),
and other contests.

<h3>Will everyone who takes the TST be placed on a team?</h3>
<del>Hopefully, but there are a few scenarios in which this may not happen. First, we can only form up to five teams 
of six since this is the limit prescribed by the HMMT
organizers. In the past, we have never come close to this limit, but it may happen in future years that 
we have too many, in which case students outside of the top 30 will be waitlisted. (It's not 
unheard of for students to drop out of the team, so some students who are waitlisted in this scenario may 
eventually be promoted.) Also, if we end up with a very awkward number of students such as 13 or 19, one or two
students may be registered as individuals. Individuals (if accepted to the tournament) still compete in all
the events, but for the Team and Guts rounds they are teamed with other individuals from other states.</del>

<i>Update for 2021 and likely future years as well: We do not plan to send individuals, and there is unlikely to ever
be any danger of us exceeding the 5 team limit. So if you sign up to join our organization, you will almost certainly be placed on one of our teams.</I>

<h3>Will everyone who is placed on a team be able to compete at the tournament?</h3>
adly, the answer to this is often "no". The reason for this is that HMMT has too many teams apply each
year to allow them all to compete. Their solution is to <del>guarantee that the top 40 teams (in Sweepstakes)
from the previous tournament are allowed to come back, and to</del> use a random lottery to decide which teams <del>apart
from those are invited</del>. HMMT has room for about 900 people, so there are usually about 150 teams that compete.
In the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the Austin Math Circle organized three teams: Texas Tornado, Texas Thunder, and
Texas Typhoon. Both years, the Texas Typhoon team has been rejected by the lottery. <del>However, this year
Texas Tornado and Texas Thunder were in the top 40 and are thus guaranteed to be invited back next year. We hope
they will remain in the top 40 in future years as well.</del>

<i>Update for 2021 and likely future years as well: HMMT has nixed the top 40 rule, and all teams are subject to the lottery.
We are none too pleased about this change, but there is nothing we can do.</i>

<h3>When do I find out if my team was accepted?</h3>
Teams are usually notified of whether or not they were accepted in early October.

<h3>What do I do if my team is not accepted?</h3>
<del>HMMT has an online mirror of its contest that teams can take remotely if they are not invited 
to compete at the contest in person. We encourage any of our teams or individuals that are turned away
by the lottery to plan to participate unofficially through the mirror. Also, there is a tiny (but nonzero)
chance that a team that was originally turned away is later accepted if enough other teams decline their
invitations. This happened to Texas Typhoon in 2019.</del>

<i>Update for 2021 and likely future years as well: Weep.</i>

<h3>Can I compete at both this contest and the one in February?</h3>
No. Due to HMMT's previously mentioned issues with not having enough space for everyone to compete, they do
not allow anyone to compete at both tournaments, or even apply for both tournaments (since registration for
both closes at the same time) in the same academic year. If you are interested in competing at the February
tournament <i>instead</i> of the November meet, there is a well-established Texas team that competes there
as well, which is organized by Momentum Learning in Sugar Land.

<h3>How do I get to and from the tournament?</h3>
<del>Students usually fly into Boston Logan airport on Friday morning, and fly out on Sunday morning, spending
two nights in a hotel, Airbnb, or something of that sort. Because not every team will be accepted to the
tournament, nobody should book a flight or a hotel room until you are sure the team you are on will be able
to compete at the tournament.</del>

<i>Update in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: Log into Zoom, blah blah blah.</i>

<h3>How expensive is the tournament?</h3>
<del>The cost of HMMT itself is trivial compared to the aforementioned plane flights and hotel rooms. It usually
comes to about $15 per person, plus some optional extras such as T-shirts (which are roughly $10 each).
Other than that, there is the cost of meals and the cost of transportation to get around Boston during
the weekend. With regard to meals, dinner the night before the contest (pizza and ice cream)
and breakfast on the morning of the contest are both provided by HMMT for free, but students pay for 
all other meals (including lunch during the contest) out of pocket.</del>

<i>Update in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: Free this year. No plane flights, no hotel rooms, and no registration fee.</i>

<h3>Should my parent/guardian come to the tournament with me?</h3>
<del>We recommend that you come with a parent, rather than traveling alone. However, this is not required. Students
who travel without parents will be responsible for looking after themselves. Usually, a group of several of
these students will share a hotel room or an Airbnb to cut down on the cost of the trip.</del>

<i>Update in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: This question is of course not applicable.</i>

<h3>What if this contest is on the same day as the Texas A&M Contest?</h3>
Since the date of the <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/outreach/highschoolcontest/">Texas A&M Math Contest</a>
is dictated largely by the university's football schedule,
it is possible (as was the case in 2019) that they are forced to put the contest on the same day as HMMT
November. If this happens, you obviously will not be able to compete at both. However, since the Texas A&M
Contest has no lottery and usually no registration deadline, it's possible for students who are placed on
a team for HMMT but find out later that they were not accepted to instead compete at Texas A&M on the same
day (instead of doing the online mirror of HMMT).

<b>In 2021, the two contests are indeed on the same day (November 13th). However, they are also both online, and the
Texas A&M contest has basically no synchronous events, so there should be little danger of conflict.</b>
